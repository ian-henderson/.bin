# zsh scripts

## Installation

Clone the zsh scripts.

`git clone https://github.com/ian-henderson/.zsh.git ~/.zsh`

Then add that directory to your path in your `~/.zshrc` file.

`export PATH=$HOME/.zsh:$PATH`

Finally, allow execution of scripts.

`chmod +x ~/.zsh/*`

Now any zsh in the directory can be ran from the terminal, e.g. `wiki zsh` or `zsh "Z shell"`.
